This shall hold all the practical knowledge gained in the pursuit of this project:

* installed html5lib & markdownify
* you can use tag.select(attrib) to select from any of the things generated by bs including the bs object itself,
    returns a list

* todo: in cooker module perhaps call get_sauce() inside cook_sauce()
* todo: in cooker module, when testing replace the get_sauce() with a local file

* hack: perhaps convert the html to markdown before posting to channel
